<h2>Old Friends</h2>
<p>So for a few weeks now, after I got settled down in Singapore. I realized that I start to feel a bit sad at times.
Call it whatever you'd like, but sometimes, especially when I have some time to think. I realize that I delve into thoughts about old friends from my life.</p>
<p>Now do keep in mind that my life is pretty short so far (21 after all), so how could I think about old friends from my life?
Not sure really, but suddenly I realized that my entire friend circle has been changed at once. And has been going through a really big change for quite sometime. 
Most of my friends are from the military service I've done. But suddenly I went to my big trip and I met a lot of people, some I clicked with more than others.
But alas, the time comes and each one flies to his own country for his trip and you just stop talking. Maybe forever. And that made me ralize about my friends from home.</p>
<p>The army is a weird experince, but one that a lot of people come out with friendships for life. But suddenly, I find that it's really hard to talk to people I used to talk to alot.
Most of the converstions just turned into "Hey, how's Singpaore??" and I answer with a short answer, because the full one will be really long but not an interesting one at that. So the conversation dies pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So I just start thinking I guess, maybe I won't be happy here. Maybe I need to go back? Maybe it's to late to go back.
Maybe I'm just depressed for a bit.
Who knows?
Old friends, huh?</p>
