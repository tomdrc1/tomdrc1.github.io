<h2>Third Time Ice Cream</h2>
<p>In Israel we have a saying "Third time ice cream", it has the same meaning as "Third time the charm". Obviously we use it as a figure of speech, but if you're a good friend / parent, and someone has told you this before the third time of doing something. You will get them Ice Cream.</p>
<p>I told this to my flatmate yesterday and he seemed keen on the fact that it's not fair for the other party that hears this saying. As you can pretty much use it maliciously for anything that you do 3 times to get free ice cream. I agreed, and obviously tried this trick on him. But it failed as he didn't seem to play along. Oh well.</p>
<p>The interesting fact about this saying is that there is folklore about the origin of it. As you might know Israel was under the British Mandate, like most of the world in various times. And apparently when guards used to do patrol, they encountered the same other guard multiple times and when they had enough they used to joke and say "next time, I'll scream!"
As Israelis do until this very day, they didn't understand the English very well and heard "next time, ice cream!"
And time did the rest and it became what we know today as "third time, ice cream!"</p>
<p>From looking online there is no evidance about this tale. But I would love to believe it, as it gives more magic to this phrase.</p>
