<h2>Waiting</h2>
<p>For the past few years now, I feel like I've always been waiting for something. Sometimes it's more tangible, but sometimes it's more abstract.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I think the first time I remember myself really waiting for something with a burning passion was when I finally got enough money to buy a VR headset. It was something I wanted for a long time.
I made the order and then came the fun part - waiting. I think that god really hated me at that time, because the order took 3.5 months to arrive. I almost went nuts. I do know why the order was delayed. I ordered it 3 days before the Corona virus pandemic started. Fun times. When I got it I was over the moon! I made myself a promise to never get sick of it. It lasted for around a year. Now I barely even touch it anymore.</p>
<p>I also waited for school to end. I hated school, I couldn't wait to start the army service. After all I got a pretty good gig there! I had around 3 months between school and army. I found a decent job in the meanwhile. But once again I was waiting.</p>
<p>When I started the army service we first have a basic course to go through. It was fun for the first week! But learning so much in a given day was a bit exhausting (8AM -&gt; 10PM). I couldn't wait to start the actual position! So once again, I was waiting.</p>
<p>When I got to my position, the first 3 months were bearable. But I quickly realized the harsh truth. I hate being in the army! It felt like my job didn't matter, and I was just passing the time. waiting for the day to end. Also my commanders were idiots. Oh well, only 2.5 more years! So here I was, waiting for the due date.</p>
<p>I did manage to go out and be an instructor later in the service. That was a really fun time. But although passing the time was nicer. I still waited for the service to end!</p>
<p>Well the service came to an end, one of the happiest days of my life. I fantasized about it daily for almost 3 years. What now? Well I started interviewing to some places to work at, and also planned a trip to Japan. One company was really interesting to me, to relocate to Singapore. But I was really waiting to fly to Japan, never been abroad really. Should be fun!</p>
<p>While in Japan, I got accepted to the company in Singapore, and also I decided to make my trip longer than expected, so my time passed really nicely while on the trip. But soon enough I found myself waiting again! To start my new life in Singapore.</p>
<p>I moved to Singapore, it was nice at first. Everything was going smooth and well, I found my job fun. After all I love teaching! I rented an apartment for the first time in my life. Everything was exciting! But soon enough I found myself with a feeling I never really felt before. I'm not waiting for anything! I was just living life, letting time pass by. And enjoying it. It was fun and relaxing at the start. But soon I started to realize I've been delving into thoughts about meaning and purpose. After all, I was waiting for nothing!</p>
<p>I guess I'm not really waiting for anything now, well only for smaller stuff than I'm used to. For example a friend coming to visit. Or maybe a movie to come out. Wondering what's the next thing I'm gonna wait for.</p>
