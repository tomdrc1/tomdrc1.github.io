<h2>Snowboarding In Japan</h2>
<p>I went snowboarding in Japan, the snowboarding itself was from the 4.1 until the 10.4 I went with my 2 Singaporean friends, Jacey and Giat. we decided to book this trip via a Singaporean travel group called "Sotravel". </p>
<p>Anyway, me and Jacey decided to fly on the 31st as it was cheaper, and to also have some time in Tokyo. So we celebrated the new years with the flight crew. Giat on the other hand decided to join a day later as she wanted to celebrate new years with her family. </p>
<p>The flight was weird, usually I'm able to sleep pretty well on flights, but on this one I fell asleep and woke up every hour, resulting in a very tiring day afterwards.</p>
<h3>Tokyo</h3>
<p>Me and Jacey landed in Tokyo, and made our way to a capsule hotel, I always wanted to stay in a capsule hotel. Last time I was in Japan I stayed in all of those fancy shmancy hotels. This was a blast. You get a small coffin like cube to sleep in. And the showers are shared obviously. Honestly, it wasn't any different than any hostel I stayed at. Just you had around 150+ capsules in the room. Unfortunately I didn't take a photo, maybe I'll try to find one online (I didn't).</p>
<p>I remember the first day being horribly slow, it felt like 3 days. We tried to kill the time until it was late enough to sleep without feeling like a 73 year old. So we went to a random park we saw on google maps. Afterwards I showed Jacey the wonders on Don Don Donki in Japan and then we dragged the time until like 20:00 when we both agreed to crash until the next day.</p>

<p>The following day Giat joined and we were finally united! We had a small side quest to find me new Blundstones. As my old pair were on literal life support, resoled a couple of times. The sole being rotten on the inside and the top absolutely worn out. After 3 shops and numerous hours walking between them I found a pair! For 250$! I had a hard time picking the colour I wanted. Until I tried on the grey ones and it just felt right. I should've listened to Giat. The grey ones were the first ones she suggested, but me being stubborn I tried all the colours until I settled on this. Also, I managed to somehow convince Jacey to buy a pair. Afterwards we continued to go around Tokyo and try a lot of crepes and foods.</p>

<p>The third day me and Jacey decided to go on a short hike to mount Takao. It was nice, first of all to break in my new blundstone as they hurt horribly. Specifically the upper back of my foot. And also to see some nature. Giat went shrine hunting that day.</p>
<p>The hike was nice, but it was wayyyyy to touristy for my taste, too many people and also the top had so many shops. Oh well, Jacey had a blast! And the route was quite pretty.</p>

<h3>Madaro</h3>
<p>Something you all should know about me by now is that I'm a default hater. Meaning I first hate and complain, and then I love and cherish. This happened with the snowboarding and the Sotravel group. Everyone had everything organized and they all talked in the telegram group before we arrived there. And that boiled my blood. It annoyed me so much, why can't you all just wait until we arrive there and meet each other naturally? So I was complaining to Jacey and Giat about the group. Also the guy managing everything was a certified idiot. He did some stuff before that annoyed me, like talking to Giat about moving me to a different room as they needed a girl-only room. Dude, if you move me, talk to me! And also the way he expressed himself on Telegram. God damnit, I'm annoyed again. Fortunately to me, Giat and Jacey seemed to complain with me, which only added fire to my Polish fueled complaining.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we took a shinkansen to Iiyama and from there a bus to the beautiful village / city Madaro. It was so peaceful, and the snow was mesmerizing. We went to a dinner with the entire group on the first night, where obviously, I stopped being a hater. The people were great! I mean there is always the weird one, who was in my room of course, but other than that the people were lovely! The instructor was obviously a jackass, but also he, grew on me by the end.</p>
<p>The day after we started learning snowboarding. And let me tell you, it's freaking hard, and as I'm writing this I still don't really get the hang of it. I can go down most slopes with hill side easily. But toe side is bizarre to me.</p>

<p>Honestly snowboarding is great. I can definitely see myself going every year. It's a true vacation. Nothing matters, you wake up early, go eat, go to the slopes. Return exhausted, drink a lot and faint asleep. Although everything does hurt. I was never as sore as I was on the second day.</p>
<h3>Myoko</h3>
<p>On the fourth day we went to Snowboard in Myoko, it's mostly green routes, but we did do the 8.5KM run from the top that the place is famous for. It was absolutely freezing that day! But still, Myoko has to be my favorite of the 3.</p>

<h3>Nozawa</h3>
<p>The day after we went to Nozawa. It's my least favorite, but Giat was over the moon. As it was her first snowboarding experience the year prior. We snowboarded for a bit, and after 2 runs I was done. Snowboarding for 5 days straight is exhausting. I just couldn't do it anymore. So we went down to have the best coffee I had in this trip, and then just relaxed there until we took the gondola up to have 1 more run down. And call it quits for good. We went to the city earlier than everyone else, and went to a gin distillery for some Gin tasting.</p>

<img alt="Nozawa4" src="../Images/Snowboarding-In-Japan_Nozawa_4.jpg" /></p>
<p>And that was it! We went back to Tokyo the following day. In a comically Singaporean fashion the entire sotravel group took a bus to Iiyama for the shinkansen. But no one said goodbye, people just disappeared. I found it hilarious.</p>
<p>Me, Jacey and Giat decided to treat our selves to a night at a regular hotel and not a capsule, so we went to check-in and have lunch. We split afterwards. I went to check a pottery place to learn a more Japanese style of making pots. And to buy some glazes to bring back to the girls who own the studio I go to in Singapore. And we had the amazing go-go curry for dinner. And I bought a bonsai to grow at home! I'm ready for that kind of commitment.</p>
<p><img alt="Pottery" src="../Images/Snowboarding-In-Japan_Pottery.jpg" />
<img alt="GoGo" src="../Images/Snowboarding-In-Japan_GoGo.jpg" /></p>
<p>And that's it! We woke up, went to a fancy coffee shop and went to the airport. Giat did manage to lose her phone on the train when we left it at Narita terminal 1. But she managed to ask one of the sotravel friends to go pick it up from the lost and found in Handea (which it somehow made it's way to). Most stressful check-in I had in a long while. Funny, last time I flew from Japan I was stressed, but it was because it was the first time I flew solo.</p>
<p>Oh well, I think this was a really good trip. One that really made me forget my troubles. As for Sotravel, there were some nice aspects, as for not having to plan anything (not that I do that regularly). But i strongly believe it's a scam, I'm sure that if I planned everything myself it would've been cheaper. Never using that service again. But the people who somehow ended up in the same group as me were really nice!</p>
