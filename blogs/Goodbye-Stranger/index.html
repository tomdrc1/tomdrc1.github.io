<h2>Goodbye Stranger</h2>
<p>"Goodbye Stranger" is a song by "Supertramp", I think I first heard it when watching "The office". There is an episode that Michael sings it. I didn't think about it much.</p>
<p>Apart from being a banger of a song, I heard it again a few months ago (and more times after that) and it made me think about my trip around Asia a lot.</p>
<p>You see when you travel you tend to meet a lot of people, because they also travel! You meet them for a short amount of time, because everyone tend to continue their journey differently.</p>
<p>I met a lot of people during my trip, some I really liked, some I hated, some I was just okay with. Sometimes my mind wanders around if I'll ever meet them again or if that was the only time I will ever see them.</p>
<p>In Japan I didn't really meet a lot of people, well only 2 close friends from Israel.</p>
<p>I think that it's because I was traveling with a friend at the time, when I flew to Thailand I was lost. I didn't think I would meet someone.</p>
<h3>Thailand</h3>
<p>When I landed that day in Bangkok, I met 2 flight attendants from the Israeli airline "ElAl". It was brief, I was with them only for a night. But they were really meaningful for me. They kinda showed me how chill Thailand was compared to Japan. The next day I met a British girl, she was doing a gap year before college. And traveling around.</p>
<p>After that, I was in Thailand mostly with a friend I met through a Whatsapp group of Israelis traveling together. In Chiang Mai, I went zip-lining and met some girls from New Zeland. Again, never saw them after. Also I met 2 Israelis in a coffee shop, they were pretty weird. One of them was obsessed with Muay Thai. And I saw the British girl from Bangkok again!</p>
<p>When I went to Pai in Thailand, I met a lot of people because I was alone for that week and a half. For example, a girl from Portugal, she was Vegan but she didn't really mention that too much. I also met a girl from Japan, she hated her job and moved to Australia. A teacher from America! She taught for like 10 years, then quit and went traveling for a year. Actually I met a lot of teachers my time traveling with the same story. I think they might be under appreciated.</p>
<p>Also met a guy from Belgium, slept in the same place as me. We actually kept in touch and he visited me in Singapore! Also some people from Israel, that knew a close friend of mine. And a group of Israelis that I would go on to see in Laos and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In Koh Samui, I didn't really meet a lot of people. there was this one older Israeli guy, I think he was 40+, he really knew how to party. He was traveling for a couple of years now and was just going between places, in Koh Phangan I actually saw the same people from Koh Samui. But also apparently a lot of Israelis started a hotel there. Go figure.</p>
<h3>Laos</h3>
<p>From there I went to Laos, I met the same British girl from Thailand again! We went on to travel together for around a week. Until we parted ways. While traveling with her, I met 2 more girls from the UK. They were 29, and envied the young girl that she had the courage to travel alone at that age. Also we met a pretty nice Aussie guy. Most of the aussies I met were super weird, and jacked.</p>
<p>My favorite was a couple of 2 Japanese older brothers. They were 60+ and they just retired and decided to travel the entirety of Asia together, we didn't manage to speak. But they were so happy and cheerful. After that I met 2 girls from Slovenia, they were in the same town as me (Vang Vieng) for 2 nights. They were super nice, and I'm actually still in contact with one of them until this very day!</p>
<p>The most unique person I met was a Laotian guy that moved to Israel, he lives there with his boyfriend and knows Hebrew really well! He was a really good translator.</p>
<p>After that, I actually managed to meet the same Israelis from Pai, we were together for 2 weeks I didn't really like a bunch of them, but some were nice. I also met a German girl, she battled with a mental problem, so she just decided to leave everything and "deal with them with amazing views". I follow her on Instagram, she found a dog to adopt in Vietnam, and she seems a lot better! </p>
<p>And a girl from the Netherlands. She was super fond of the Israeli group mentioned before. So we just adopted her. And I met another 4 Israelis that were super nice, and I talk to one of them from time to time.</p>
<h3>Vietnam</h3>
<p>To Vietnam, I found myself flying with the 2 Israelis from the group that I disliked the most. It was kinda a mistake. So I parted ways with them after the first day in Vietnam. The next day I met a Canadian couple in their 50s. They told me they didn't have kids. I guess they didn't want them, but they were super nice. They adopted me for the day and I went with them to a museum.</p>
<p>After that I went to a couple of attractions and met some people briefly. Someone who came to Vietnam from USA for 2 days, I saw her only in the ride to the attraction. And 2 people from Germany. One was Vietnamese. We did the Ha Long Bay together, they were nice. I also met a really nice Italian guy, he was 35+ and he seemed a bit tired of life. So he just picked up a remote job and went traveling. We even went to dinner together after coming back. He was a really chill fella.</p>
<p>In Ninh binh I met someone from Hungary, he was a nice fella. But he really asked me to take a lot of pictures for him. Also I met someone from Dubai, she didn't really like the fact I was from Israel, oh well.
Also, I met the same Japanese older guys from Laos! By random luck at the top of a hike we did. We both recognized each other. And had a good laugh with the language barrier. and of course, the Israeli group that I don't like, yay!</p>
<p>Then I went to Sa pa, there I went to stay at a "Mama" which is just a village woman that let's you stay at her home, paid of course. There I met the 3 funniest Israelis I met during my trip. 2 boys and 1 girl. They were always high but also super friendly. I went on to do the Loop with them afterwards.</p>
<p>In the Ha Giang Loop, I was with the same Israelis from Sa Pa, but also 2 new Israelis. Which apparently were from the "Beit Habad" in Hong Kong. Which is the Jewish representative in a lot of countries. After the loop, while waiting for the ride to the airport to Taiwan, I met the sister of someone I met really briefly in Thailand, which would connect us because she was also in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan</h3>
<p>In Taiwan when I was landing I met someone from the Netherlands, that apparently had studied in Singapore, she didn't really seem interested in talking to me. But I asked her a bit about Singapore before we parted ways.</p>
<p>Then I met the bigger sister of the girl from Vietnam, she was honestly the best travel partner I had in the entire trip. We knew when to do attractions together, but also when each one of us would want to travel alone. I was with her the entire time I was in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Together we met some guys from America, one of them would go the same day that we met him. The other stayed with us for a couple of days and then we would see him on and off when we went to new destinations. They were pretty weird to say the least.</p>
<p>We also stayed together at "Beit Simcha", which is a Taiwanese person that will give Israeli people a place to stay. He was super nice, he even sends "happy holiday" to me when an Israeli holiday comes around! There we met another 2 Israeli girls, they were a bit boring honestly. I can't really remember anything about them.</p>
<p>Also when I did travel alone, I met a ton of local Taiwanese people. They were really the nicest people I met during my trip.</p>
<p>From there I flew to Singapore to start my job. On the plane I met a really nice family, they asked me about my job and if I needed any advice to reach out to them. I didn't really reach out though.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Phew! I know this was a long read but honestly, it was more for myself than anyone else.</p>
<p>I do have to say that I follow most of the people I met on Instagram or other means of social network. And with them I can still kinda understand how they are. But the rest of them, I will probably never see again. Which is okay!</p>
<p>But I guess that what I wanted to say is that I really do still wonder about them as they pop up in my mind from time to time. Each one of them had different goals and points of view. And like the song says, I really hope that "your dreams will come true".</p>
