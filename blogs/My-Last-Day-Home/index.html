<h2>My Last Day Home</h2>
<p>On October 6th, 2023. It was my last day back home. It sounds dramatic, but I don't mean it to be. What I mean was that it was my last day living under my parents. The day after, I had a flight to Japan planned. I was supposed to be there only for a month, but a few days prior I decided to increase my trip by a month and go to Thailand afterwards. So I did just that. </p>
<p>I remember that day vividly, it was Friday, back in Israel Friday is actually the first day of the weekend, as our weekend is Friday-Saturday. I woke up late, I was exhausted because before the trip I wanted to meet as many people as I could. I had a feeling that I would be gone more than 2 months. So there I was, meeting multiple friends every day until the night. I think I was with friends on Thursday night so when I came back home I was really tired.</p>
<p>I woke up late, did something in the house, having coffee and waking up or something. And I started packing my suitcase. I was nervous. I was never overseas really, so going overseas for 2 months. And to Asia? And to Japan?! People always told me that it was like landing in Space! Everyone is so different there. So I went bouldering. To also say goodbye to some friends, and to take the edge off.</p>
<p>I went around noon, I stayed until around 15:00. I was there with a friend and his friend. We bouldered and then as the session came to an end we went outside. My friend brought me a coke zero, his treat. And I think he left, told me goodbye and left. Then I remember expressing my concerns about the trip to my friend's friend. I don't remember his name, or where he is now. But he told me that all my fears are normal and natural. And that he was shaking his first time flying. But after that initial fear, I will experience being my self, truly, for the first time. Because for our entire life we have masks. A mask for school, a mask for friends, a mask for the army. But for the first time in my life. No one would know me. No one will also really care! They will be too busy traveling. And all the places I will be, I wont even know the language! The perfect place to be my true self. There are no expectations. No people that know a specific version of me. I'll be a true nowhere man! This stuck with me, throughout my trip, and even to this very day. I have no idea where he is today. But I saw him in a group for Israelis about traveling in Vietnam after I moved to Singapore. So I reckon he did another trip for himself.</p>
<p>We exchanged numbers, I even think I added him to a group about updates from my trip. And we parted ways. I went home, had lunch or something and then I packed. I had a few hours left to pack but then I decided that the best thing to do with that time was to tinker with an emulator for the PS3 on my PC. I know, I'm a nerd. But I think I just wanted to distract myself. I did that and packed here and there when I got sick of it. My mom obviously helped and by around 23:00 I was done packing. I wasn't ready to go to sleep yet though. I think I fell asleep only around 2 AM.</p>
<p>4:30 AM I woke up. Took my suitcase. Woke up my dad, my mom gave me a hug and told me "Don't disappear, text and call!" afterwards my dad took me to the airport. We hugged and then I went through the fastest check-in I ever had. I was there around 5:20 AM. Got some MCD nuggets. And met Guy there. And then 6 AM rolled around and October 7th happened. But that's a story for another day.</p>
<p>I was right in the end. I went for a trip, and without realizing I became a young adult. Renting a house, living on my own, having a job. Didn't even realize that day will be my last day home. I did go to visit home back in May, but it wasn't the same.</p>
