<h2>Trip To Israel</h2>
<p>So I went back to travel to Israel and visit some friends. (3.5 -&gt; 11.5)</p>
<p>It's been 7 months since I was last there. I didn't really expect anything surprising, I was actually qutie apathetic to the whole ordeal.
I flew from Singapore to Greece and then from Greece to Israel. The whole trip took roughly 15 hours. I managed to sleep the entire flight from Singapore!</p>
<p>When I came back home I realized that everything was the same! I came home put my bags and then hugged everyone and just like that. I was back in my old room with my old items, like I never left.</p>
<p>Obviously there were a few differences, for example, my dad turned my room into his office (that's only fair).</p>
<p>After I was home for 2 days I went to sleep at a good friends' house in Tel Aviv. I didn't really realize how much I missed him, it was amazing to see him again.</p>
<p>And that started the "meeting" people phase, I met so many people over the 5 days I was sleeping at his house, I was literally seeing a different person for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.
I also went out with old friends from my army course, we went to a bar and got pretty drunk haha.</p>
<p>When I flew back to Singapore I flew with a good friend of mine because he came to work with me for a month and a half. We had some good lauhgs over the flight to Dubai and then From Dubai to Singapore we both just passed out.</p>
<p>I actually managed to miss Singapore over the 9 days I was in Israel, but when I came back I was super confused for a couple of days, I also denied the concept of Jet-Lag thinking it will help me to not fall victim to it. I was wrong! I slept horrible for the first week and also now there are still some artifacts. And Singapore also felt different. But after a few days everything was the same really. Wonder when I will be back to Israel.</p>
<p>Definitely missed the Mala :)</p>
