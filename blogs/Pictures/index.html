<h2>Pictures!</h2>
<p>For the longest while now I wanted to add picture support to this site. But I was procrastinating like a champ.</p>
<p>Today was an extremely slow day at work today, so I used the time to call a friend I haven't talked to in quite a while. I told him how bored I was and that I don't know what to do. He said - "Why not finally add Pictures to your site?"</p>
<p>So I said why not? And I started working on it, honestly I really enjoyed it! I should start doing these kind of stuff more, instead of letting time pass me by and procrastinating.</p>
<p>So thanks Oren for being my panic monster for today!</p>

<p>Also I want to add pictures for previous blogs, to add more life to it, but maybe on another day ;)</p>
