<h2>Run Run Running</h2>
<p>Today is Friday, yesterday I came back home and saw my flat mate (KASUN). We talked about how we both haven't really ran in the last couple of days. We both agreed that we're just busy doing other stuff in the evenings, so no real time to go out for a run.</p>
<p>After some regular banter (me making fun of him being old and him making fun of me for being young back). I asked him why not wake up tomorrow at 6 AM and run, and so we agreed. If one of us didn't wake up, we owe the other a "Wok Hey". (A stir fry place Kasun likes).</p>
<p>I went to sleep yesterday at around 23:00. I mean, I entered my bed at around 23:00. I fell asleep at around 1 AM.</p>
<p>When I woke up it actually reminded me of one time in my service when we had to do a morning drill to the students, so we had to be up and at 'em at 4 AM. Fun times.</p>
<p>To my surprise he was awake as well, so no Wok Hey this time. Anyway, we went running and it was super fun! It was a relatively short run (around 3 KM). But being outside so early was also so peaceful. Maybe something about knowing everyone is asleep, so no rush to check the phone or be online.</p>
<p>It's 7:52 now as I'm writing this. I feel super productive, I already ran, wrote this and also even started some laundry for the weekend. Usually I wake up around now like a zombie, make my way to the kitchen to gulp coffee and run down to make my way to work. So it's a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>We might continue this ritual, but only time will tell really. </p>
<p>I did only sleep like 4:30 hours really, so that will surely come back to bite me later. Oh well, it's a sacrifice I'm okay with making.</p>
