<h2>Waking Up Late</h2>
<p>I think that in life I fluctuate a lot with my sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I have times where I get up early every day and stay productive, and I have times where I wake up at around 15:00 and let time pass by.</p>
<p>The worst was when I was around the age of 15-16 and it was summer. I think I messed up my sleep schedule so bad that I went to sleep at around 6:00 - 8:00 and woke up around 16:00 - 18:00. It was horrible! Especially because I had to fix it for school when summer ended. It was like being Jet-Lagged without flying!</p>
<p>As I grew up I still had this problem but I set myself this mental limit. So I have to wake up until 12:00 and go to sleep at 3:00 max. When I did have this schedule a problem that I had was that I felt like I was wasting the days! But I still didn't really care. Because I had all the time in the world.</p>
<p>Later when I was in the army I used to wake up around 6:30 every morning. When the weekend came I used to sleep until ~11:00. Which is not a problem but I still felt bad that I was wasting the only days off I had.</p>
<p>Currently I wake around 7:30 every morning, and go to work. The thing is that now on the last few weekends I really let myself go. I wake up at around 11:00 - 13:00 if I have nothing planned. And the weird thing is that I don't care the slightest!</p>
<p>I wonder what changed? Maybe that I don't feel the pressure of not having enough time? Or maybe it's because I don't have anything planned in the weekends really so I just go with the flow.</p>
<p>Any way, it's refreshing not to care. It does make the days feel a bit bland though. As it doesn't really matter to me if it's a work day or if it's the weekend. It's just that on workdays I have work and need to get up earlier in the day.</p>
