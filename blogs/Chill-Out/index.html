<h2>Chill Out</h2>
<p>For the last two weeks now I suddenly realized that I've been very chill about life. Flowing with it, not stressing about much.</p>
<p>Honestly it has been quite nice. I haven't over thought about anything in a couple of days now. Meaning I haven't gone into a spiral about it, I still overthink a bit. But my mind is so quiet! Also I feel like I've been not wanting to answer people on the phone or check it as much. It feels so mentally draining to be on the phone. So what's the rush?</p>
<p>But, there is always a but, I think it's because I'm so tired. I've been filling my days with activities, and not really letting my self have some alone time. And when I do I'm busy with stuff, for example I learned a bunch of chords on the Piano! And as a result I've had not a lot of time to over think.
I don't know where I'm going with this, but I haven't written in a while. And also this has been on my mind.</p>
<p>Today is Saturday, I slept for around 9 hours. I needed that, as I said. I'm so tired! But some of the over thinking came back. Oh well, at least it's nice not being a zombie.
Also I've been wanting to call this post chill out because I've been out chillin' (get it?)</p>
<p>But as life would want it, I woke up today to my air conditioner leaking water. So I guess that the real chill-out.
It's quite an annoyance really, I just wanted to sleep in this weekend and have some quiet. But I hope that at least it's quite funny that it happened right? So there's that.</p>
