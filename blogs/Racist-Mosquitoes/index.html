<h2>Racist Mosquitoes</h2>
<p>A few weeks after I moved into the current apartment that I'm staying at, we had a small mosquitoes problem!</p>
<p>The problem was that we had mosquitoes around the house, just flying around and biting us. The peculiar thing was that the only victim was my Sri Lankan flatmate.</p>
<p>After a small debate with him, I came to a conclusion that the mosquitoes must be racist, thus biting only him. He did not seem to agree with me.</p>
<p>They did seem to have dissapered, haven't seen them for a couple of months now. Maybe they moved on from their racism.</p>
