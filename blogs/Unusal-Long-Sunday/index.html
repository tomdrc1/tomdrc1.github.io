<h2>Unusual Long Sunday</h2>
<p>Today is an unusual long Sunday.</p>
<p>Me and my flat mate so far kept the running in the morning. It's the second time now. So I'm awake since 6:00 AM.</p>
<p>After that I went to eat Kaya toast as I haven't had one in quite some time. And then I got motivation out of nowhere, so I cleaned the entire house and my room. I even baked cookies.</p>
<p>I did all of that and the hour was around 13:00.</p>
<p>Afterwards I joined my friends for bouldering, and then we went to eat, and afterwards I went home. From then I didn't really do much. I played the piano, I saw an episode of "House of the Dragon". The new season is okay so far.</p>
<p>I think the time was around 18:00, I was awake for like 12 hours at that point. I napped for 15 minutes and played a game. Then I felt like writing this. </p>
<p>Seems like time is moving super slow today. Or it might be the fact that usually I only wake up by the time I made the cookies today.</p>
<p>Another thing that might play a part here is that I'm a bit stressed today, first there is a friend that I've been waiting to see that arrived to Singapore today. So my mind has been occupied by this. And also tomorrow I should have a talk with my boss. It shouldn't be a bad one, rather a "where are we going forward" one, Now that I've been here for around half a year. But I'm still anxious about that.</p>
<p>I did also have a call with my mom, after not talking with her for 2 months straight. I should call her more. And also I'll call my grandparents now.</p>
