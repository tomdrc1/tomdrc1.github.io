<h2>Safe Business</h2>
<p>So I was asked by my company to take a 2 day office safety seminar (08.07.2024 - 09.07.2024). Because someone has to hold this certificate for some reason. And obviously I was chosen.</p>
<p>It wasn't enjoyable to say the least, but honestly it wasn't thaaaat bad.</p>
<p>I felt like I was in high school again, sitting in class, while a charisma-less lecturer was saying words to pass the bare minimum of information he had to pass to us. Heck, he even told us the answers to the test, he even started the course saying there is a 100% pass rate.</p>
<p>I think this time though, unlike my time in high school I really didn't care (not that I cared in highschool, but still). I was just on my phone most of the time, and when not, I was floating away in my mind. Letting my imagination run wild. Didn't really pay any attention. It was a good thing honestly, came at the right time as having time to process some thoughts was a bit necessary right now.</p>
<p>Another thing that was hard is that the lecturer had a really strong Singaporean accent. Which usually is not a bad thing, I love that accent. But for the life of me I couldn't understand 90% of what he said.</p>
<p>I did learn some stuff, like how much bureaucracy Singapore has, and how it's super stupid. And how I'm probably never gonna use this system. Also they showed us so many videos of Singaporeans dying from work accidents. With no censorship.</p>
<p>In any case, I rate it a strong 4/10. Would not do it again, but it's nice to forcefully get bored from time to time.</p>
