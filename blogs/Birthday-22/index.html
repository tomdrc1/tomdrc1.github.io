<h2>Birthday 22</h2>
<p>I never really cared for my birthday, but it's today. A really good friend of mine always asked me to think about where I was on my last birthday and where I am today.</p>
<p>So funny enough last year I was still in the army, it was nearing the end of my second course I instructed. I was in Beer Sheba at the time, I don't even think I knew I wanted to move to Singapore at that time. If I recall correctly, on that day it was official that I wouldn't need to do my extra 3 years in the army, I remember jumping from joy and excitement!</p>
<p>After a few weeks the course ended, it was a really emotional day. I remember going to my commander's wedding on that day, it was the first time I drank so much that I embarrassed myself and also puked, but I couldn't care less, I was free!!!</p>
<p>And then came my big trip, I had around 2 weeks between getting off my enlistment and going on the trip. So I made sure to say goodbye to all my friends, looking back I had a feeling that I would not return any time soon. But I really didn't know that, in my mind I was only supposed to go for 2 months. One in Japan, and one in Thailand.</p>
<p>So on the 7th of October I was set to fly to Japan, and yadi yadi yada a war broke out on the same day. I only wanted to get out of the country, and I did. It was weird at first because there was a war and here I was just enjoying life. But after assurances from friends and family I traveled guilt free. I was a month in Japan then Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Taiwan and finally Singapore. It was amazing! The amount of new cultures that I was getting to know. And all the new places! And all the people I met! It felt like time was infinite, I felt like I was 21 forever.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Singapore. It was exciting at first but then I felt like I was stuck and time was moving sooooooooooooooooooo fast. Had a lot of downs and ups. But sometimes I reminded myself that in this year I got out of the army, went to 6 countries and relocated. So not a bad year at all.</p>
<p>I guess I'm 22 now, I wonder what this year has in store for me, maybe next year I'll find myself in another country. But I really don't know, heck, on the same date last year I didn't even know I would get out of the army. Who's laughing now huh?</p>
<p>I do want to have a small bucket list for this year, maybe learn 5 new songs to play by heart on the piano? Also, I really want to visit Australia, maybe I'll do that.</p>
<p>Also I've wrote this now as I came back from bouldering with a new group that I met, they are really nice people. In a way they adopted me to their group. On midnight they all told me happy birthday, it was really heartwarming. So far, a good start. I wonder where I'll be next year, but any way, I hope to write another post like this.</p>
