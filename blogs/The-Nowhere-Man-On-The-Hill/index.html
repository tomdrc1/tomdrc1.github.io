<h2>The Nowhere Man On The Hill</h2>
<p>As you can infer from the title I'm going to talk about two very famous songs of The Beatles. Being "Nowhere Man" and "The Fool on the Hill".</p>
<p>I always listened to The Beatles but I think this year I started listening to a lot more songs, and I came across these two.</p>
<p>Basically, both of the songs talk about a man, be it the fool on the hill, or the nowhere man. And about the fact that they live in their own little world. Where they are disconnected from society, and they let the time pass doing their own little meaningless stuff. They don't try to find people, or try to make their plans meaningful, they gave up on trying to do that.</p>
<p>I think that the reason I'm writing about this is because I felt / still feeling really similar to that. I tried making some local friends here or to find some meaningful stuff, but it didn't really work out. It wasn't fun to say the least. But oh well. So there I found myself, slowly giving up. Until I became like the fool on the hill. Doing my own little stupid stuff, letting time pass me by. It worked! Half a year went by already. But I was feeling really meaningless. Is that really all there is? Only making my nowhere plans on my nowhere land? Well, I guess I over did it. I started feeling like everything was meaningless! Even my work. I love teaching! And the friends that I did have. So why does it feel like noting I did mattered?</p>
<p>I think the reason was that I'm scared to get invested in something. Because if I gave meaning to something, it will hurt if it will not work out right? Like the girl who ghosted me, or the Singaporeans who I boulder with who just disappear. So okay, I'll have my meaningless plans, and if it's meaningful actually, no worries! I'll just act like it's not! And here I am, a fool on the hill.</p>
<p>I noticed this behavior a few days ago, and I decided that I have to stop doing that. It's a bit hard honestly. Because I got used to it, but suddenly life is a bit more colorful. It's no longer "Yeah, I play the piano" it's "I really enjoy playing the piano. And I'm excited to learn new songs to play!" or if I meet someone while bouldering, I'll get excited, although they might not respond! Even if it will hurt. If it will work out, it will be exciting!</p>
<p>Maybe I'm still dumb on the hill, but at least I'm becoming less of a fool :)</p>
