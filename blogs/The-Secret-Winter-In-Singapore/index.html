<h2>The Secret Winter In Singapore</h2>
<p>I don't know what happened today, but I woke up and I looked outside of my window and I saw gloomy skies and a lot of rain. So far pretty normal for Singapore. But the real kick was that it was cold!</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that when I say cold in Singapore I mean around 24C. Still, it's a real nice change of pace. (I looked it up just now and apparently it was around 29-30C all day. Still felt colder, so that was fun)</p>
<p>It was magical really, I walked around with my regular work clothes (long pants and a t-shirt) and I wasn't melting! Just nice cold-ish weather and rain all day. I wished I was home napping. The entire day I had a feeling like I was in Israel with our so-so fake winter.</p>
<p>I also went to watch "Miss Saigon" today with local friends. I had no idea what this musical was about but it was a nice musical set in the Vietnam war era, I recommend. When I went inside it was still cold-ish and raining a bit, When I left (2.5 hours later) it was already back to normal. Oh well, such is life in Singapore. At least I got excited about it being cold, hasn't happened in a while.</p>
<p>I suppose this is the "Winter" the locals mention once in a while, hope I can experience another one before next year.</p>
