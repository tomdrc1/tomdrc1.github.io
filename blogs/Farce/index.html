<h2>Farce</h2>
<p>One of my best friends from the army is a really logical person, which I really appreciate as I am more of an emotional one. And he serves as a great counter point of view.</p>
<p>Anyway, when stuff used to happen to me that would upset me, and they happened before (for example, a girl I'm interested in ghosted me). He used to tell me a quote by Karl Marx.</p>
<p><strong>"History repeats itself, first as a tragedy, second as farce."</strong></p>
<p>Farce being a french word for "a comedy that seeks to entertain an audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, ridiculous, absurd, and improbable"</p>
<p>Well I guess I'm on a farce again, I mean, I have to be. Otherwise it will be a tragedy. And I prefer to have a tad of humor in my life.</p>
<p>Met someone in Singapore a while ago, and I was really interested. It was on and off because most of the time she was back in her home country. We started talking again a bit before she finally moved the Singapore. Come the day she finally moves to Singapore for a relocation and suddenly she ghosts me after a day. Not sure if I did something wrong really. But I really am hoping she's alright. She did ghost me before, but I guess I was okay with it, because what, we will talk over WhatsApp for a couple of months? It's stupid! She's the smart one! To put it on hold so we can just live our lives until she moves back. So I guess this time is the farce right?</p>
<p>I have to be completely honest here. I didn't really know her that well, we only met 3 times in person and texting felt like there was still something that is holding back. maybe I was so invested because I was looking for meaning in moving to Singapore? It's not fair I know. But let's try to not be hypocrites here.</p>
<p>Well, in any case, it hurts, really hurts. But I guess it is for the better or something. At least it's a farce this time, so I can laugh a bit.</p>
