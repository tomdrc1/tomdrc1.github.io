<h2>Life Is Not A Guava</h2>
<p>When I was little and I used to complain about something to my dad, he always used to say "Well Tom, Life is not a Guava!"</p>
<p>A pretty weird sentence if you ask me, what does it even mean? A Guava is a smelly fruit, and the taste is not that sweet either. So you're saying that life is not smelly? Or that it's not not sweet? So it's good?
Any way, it kinda made sense to me. As I remember he really liked Guava, we used to complain about the smell, and he used to eat it like a treat.</p>
<p>It stuck with me throughout the years and when my friends used to complain about stuff, I became my dad for a second and said "Well X, Life is not a Guava!" Causing them the same confusion that I once had.
Recently a good friend of mine came to Singapore for a month and a half, and I realized that I kept saying that phrase to her. So I had enough and decided to ask my dad about the origin of the phrase, and he answered:</p>
<p>"Actually it's a pretty dumb phrase that has no meaning from my army days. The name of the fruit is funny and it's also a controversial fruit. The main purpose is to make the other party laugh, and leave them wondering about what was said</p>
<p>Actually life is like a Guava - some like it, some don't, and for some it smells."</p>
<p>So I suppose we both used the sentence wrong throughout the years. But I know that I will keep using it.
After all, life is not a Guava.</p>
