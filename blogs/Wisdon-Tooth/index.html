<h2>Wisdom Tooth</h2>
<p>I took out both my upper left and lower left Wisdom Teeth on the 25th of May.</p>
<p>Because of that, I got a week of MC. Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a procedure. I was super nervous from it though.</p>
<p>It took around an hour of having my mouth open, and both of them were out. I expected severe pain but honestly it wasn't that bad after the first day. The horrible part was the eating afterwards.</p>
<p>I had to follow a "soft" diet, so a lot of yoghurt, some Oladi Pancakes (from Russian cuisine). And a lotttt of scrambled eggs. It wasn't that bad honestly it did just get a tad repetative.</p>
<p>I had a lot of plans for my time home, like playing a lot of the Piano, or playing some video games that I had in my backlog. But I ended up doing none of that! I just found myself slouching around and doing nothing. Just watching random Youtube Videos and letting time pass by. Usually I feel pretty bad about not using my time well enough, but this week for some reason I really didn't care.</p>
<p>I did manage to go back to normal around Yesterday, I started to finally play the Piano a bit and also even wrote this website that you're reading this on!</p>
<p>Also sleeping a lot has been really nice, apperantly I was super tired, I just didn't realize it until now.</p>
