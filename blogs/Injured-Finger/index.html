<h2>Injured Finger</h2>
<p>Well it was bound to happen sooner or later, I've been bouldering for 3+ years now more or less. The most severe injury that I had was around 1.5 years ago when my rotator cuff was aching when I was reaching up to holds.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went bouldering, in general the entire day I felt a bit off, like not really there. Welp, went to Bouldering, had some ruff start and didn't really warm up correctly. And then went onto a dino route, the last hold was a crimp. I held it for dear life with really bad form and basically hanged my entire body weight on 3 fingers aaaaaaand *POP*!</p>
<p>Felt funky at first but okay, I guess my body didn't really process what happened. So I took it a bit easy but continued climbing. As I cooled down it became more hard to move my finger and to close my hand.</p>
<p>The finger in question is my ring finger and the pain is mostly in the lower part of my forearm and the middle part of palm in my hand.</p>

<p>Always heard that finger injuries are the worst, so here we go. Hope it can recover fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Today when I woke up it was horrible, barely could close my hand, or even move my finger! But it got better as the day went on</p>
