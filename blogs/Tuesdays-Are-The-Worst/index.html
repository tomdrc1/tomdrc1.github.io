<h2>Tuesdays Are The Worst</h2>
<p>I had dinner with a good friend today, and I mentioned the fact that I had trouble sleeping last night.
He asked me why and I said that I wanted to delay the time I went to sleep as long as I could because I wasn't that excited to go to work.</p>
<p>He replied with basically a "Mondays huh?" To which I replied that actually, Tuesdays are the worst!</p>
<p>This specific phrase goes back to my army days. I used to be sad about Mondays like any other person. And I made sure to express that disappointment. One day a friend of mine said "cheer up! At least you were at home today!"</p>
<p>Then he went on, explaining to me that actually Tuesdays are the worst. "Think about it! On Mondays, you still have the taste of home. You came from the weekend! Tuesdays are the furthest away from the weekend, and are the closest to the start of the week. Wednesday is basically Thursday, which is a day before Friday. And on Friday, you get to go back home! That's why, Tuesdays, are the worst."</p>
<p>So I told that to my friend. To which he replied: "Wait, I think that Sundays are the worst then. You have all the stress of anticipating the work week, which is much more horrible than actually going through it."</p>
<p>I thought about it for a bit, and I have to agree. But still, out of the work week, Tuesdays are the worst!</p>
