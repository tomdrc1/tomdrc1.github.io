<h2>Safe Travels!</h2>
<p>When I was traveling, as you do, you meet quite a lot of people. Some I loved, some I hated and some are just neutral. </p>
<p>Usually when you say goodbye, both parties understand that we will probably never see each other again. So when you say your farewells you choose your words carefully, at least I tried to.</p>
<p>When I first had to say goodbye to one of the people I traveled with, he said something that stuck with me. "It was fun, hope everything will be good, and safe travels!".</p>
<p>Safe travels stuck with me. In a way, this backpacking trip is a journey, and what is the best wish I can give someone on a journey? To travel safe. I loved that, and ever since then, I used that when I said my goodbyes "I only wish you that everything will be good, and safe travels!".</p>
<p>I used to work in a university back in Israel, and right before we went into lockdown our professor told us that we will probably not see each other for a long time so we started wishing each other wishes.
As we were talking and wishing stuff to each other, he said something that also stuck with me throughout the years: "Tom, as you grow older you realize that the most boring, and least exciting wishes are the ones we want."</p>
<p>"If I wish someone happiness, I truly mean it, I want him to only have happiness! Be healthy! No diseases or anything bad. All those other sophisticated wishes just don't make alot of sense when you think about it".</p>
<p>And I think safe travels fits right in. What do I want to wish to that person I'm parting my ways with? That he will reach all of his destinations safe and sound.</p>
